This exercise will allow you to obtain experience with working with cryptographic libraries. For this purpose, you are to write a program in a programming language of your choice and you can use a cryptographic library or libraries of your choice, but the program should run on the UB CSE Fall 2019 virtual machine image (Ubuntu) which can be downloaded from https: //cse.buffalo.edu/~eblanton/misc/vm/. The image can be used from any operating system using a suitable VM environment software such as, e.g., VirtualBox. Once you start the VM, you can run commands from a terminal and directly write your program in the VM (using an editor such as emacs) or transfer your program written elsewhere to the VM. While you are not constrained in the programming language or cryptographic library choice, this handout provides help with writing and running your program in C, Java, or python, as described later in this document.

Once you start the VM, you can run commands from a terminal and directly write your program in the VM (using an editor such as emacs) or transfer your program written elsewhere to the VM. While you are not constrained in the programming language or cryptographic library choice, this handout provides help with writing and running your program in C, Java, or python, as described later in this document.
This exercise will allow you to obtain experience with working with cryptographic libraries.

While you are not constrained in the programming language or cryptographic library choice, this handout provides help with writing and running your program in C, Java, or python, as described later in this document.
This exercise will allow you to obtain experience with working with cryptographic libraries. For this purpose, you are to write a program in a programming language of your choice and you can use a cryptographic library or libraries of your choice, but the program should run on the UB CSE Fall 2019 virtual machine image (Ubuntu) which can be downloaded from https: //cse.buffalo.edu/~eblanton/misc/vm/.
